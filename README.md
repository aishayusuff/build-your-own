[Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) is an initiative aimed at helping software engineers become better through weekly coding challenges that build real world applications. 
Through these weekly **Build Your Own** challenges, I will embark on my Kotlin (with Ktor) journing as this initiative is also recommended for [learning new programming languages](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/).

- [Build Your Own wc Tool](wcTool): This challenge is the first I will try and it uses file I/O principles. It involves building your own version of the Unix command line tool **wc**. Detailed requirements of each of the 7 steps of this challenge can be found [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc) (there are visual guidance of what each step should ouput). I have relied on Kotlin's [official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) (as I am new to this syntax) and ChatGPT to help me make sense of this challenge -- and the goal is to become self-reliant as I progress.
